# Cowsay_Cows Directory

The **Cowsay_Cows** directory is intended to store .cow files that provide a template for cowsay moscots. Cowsay is a MOTD (message of the day) type program that displays a random mascot and fortune everytime a new terminal is opened. Whether it be to give you an exerpt from a book, popular sayings, or funny quotes, cowsay will help you keep your sanity as you develop your code.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Cowsay_Cows** directory:

1. Each cow file should contain a small (not large) ASCII animal, logo, or robot. Large ASCII art can be annoying.
2. Any .cow file added to this directory will automatically have the change to be used during every terminal startup.

Utilize the toggle_cowsay.sh script in the `tools/` directory to enable or disable cowsay.

COWSAY!
